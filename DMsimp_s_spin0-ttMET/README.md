# Production cross sections for tt+DM via a (pseudo)scalar mediator with DMSimp_s_spin0

Cross sections for the process p p > xd xd~ t t~ / a z w+ w- are calculated at fixed order at both LO and NLO. 

They were produced using standalone MG_aMC v2.6.5, LHAPDF v6.2.1, and DMsimp_s_spin0 (http://feynrules.irmp.ucl.ac.be/wiki/DMsimp). 

Example files containing the MG commands required to generate the cross-sections can be found in ttDM_S20_c1_LO.txt and ttDM_S20_c1_NLO.txt for a scalar mediator with m_med = 20 GeV, m_DM = 1 GeV at LO and NLO, respectively.

The couplings of the mediator to SM particles and DM particles were set to g_SM = g_DM = 1.
