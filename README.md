# signal-cross-sections

Shared cross section numbers to use for benchmark models to ensure consistent results across experiments.

Please place the cross section numbers using the scheme:
  \<model name\>-\<final state\>-\<some other parameters\>.txt
where:
  - \<model name\> follows the naming scheme for the models (as stored at https://github.com/LHC-DMWG/model-repository/tree/master/models), e.g. "DMsimp_s_spin1" or "Pseudoscalar_2HDM"
  - \<final state\> is the final state, e.g., "tt+MET"
  - \<some other parameters\> is an optional field that can also be empty.
